# Market Basket Analysis

This project applies Market Basket Analysis to grocery transaction data using the Apriori algorithm. It identifies frequent itemsets and association rules to uncover valuable product pairings based on support, confidence, and lift metrics. These insights can help inform promotional bundling and product placement strategies in a retail setting.

## Project Overview

- Objective: Identify frequently co-purchased grocery items using association rules
- Modeling Technique: Apriori algorithm for frequent itemsets
- Dataset: Grocery transactions dataset from Kaggle (contains item lists per transaction)
